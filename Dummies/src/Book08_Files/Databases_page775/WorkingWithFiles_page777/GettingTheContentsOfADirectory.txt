/*
    A directory is a file that contains a list of other files or directories.
    Because a directory is just a special type of file, itâ€™s represented by an object of the File class.
    You can tell whether a particular File object is a directory by calling its isDirectory method.
    If this method returns true, the File is a directory. Then you can array of all the files contained in
    the directory by calling the listFiles method.

>> Example:
   > StringVariablePath & StringVariable2.
