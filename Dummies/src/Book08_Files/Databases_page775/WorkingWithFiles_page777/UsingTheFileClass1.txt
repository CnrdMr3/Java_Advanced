/*
    The File class is your key to processing files and directories. A File object represents a single file or directory.
    Note that the file or directory doesn't actually have
    to exist on your hard drive. Instead, the File object represents a file that may or
    may not actually exist.

>> Technical stuff:
   Java uses a single class to represent both files and directories because a directory
   is actually nothing more than a special type of file. I suppose that the designers
   of Java could have created a separate Directory class to represent directories, but
   then youâ€™d have to know how to use two classes instead of one.

   The File class is in the java.io package, so any program that uses it should
   import java.io.File or java.io.*.

>> Tip:
   Java 1.7 introduces a new Path class, which is designed to replace the File class.
