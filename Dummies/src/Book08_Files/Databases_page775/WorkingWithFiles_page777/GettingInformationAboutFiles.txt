/*
    Several of the methods of the File class simply return information about a file or
    directory. You can find out whether the File object represents a file or directory,
    for example, by calling its isDirectory or isFile method. Other methods let you
    find out whether a file is read-only or hidden, or retrieve the file’s age and the
    time when it was last modified.

    You can get the name of the file represented by a File object in several popular
    ways:

    » To get just the filename, use the getName method. This method returns a
    string that includes just the filename, not the complete path.
    » To get the path that was specified to create the File object (such as \logs\
    hit.log), use the toString method instead.

    » To get the full path for a file — that is, the complete path including the drive
    letter (for Windows systems) and all the directories and subdirectories leading
    to the file — use the get CanonicalPath method. This method removes any
    system-dependent oddities such as relative paths, dots (which represent the
    current directory), and double dots (which represent the parent directory) to
    get the file’s actual path.
