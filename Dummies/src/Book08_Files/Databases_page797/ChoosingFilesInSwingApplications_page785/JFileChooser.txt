/*
    For the most part, you don’t want to mess around with command-line parameters
    in Swing applications. Instead, you want to use the JFileChooser class to let
    users pick the files they want to work with. This class lets you display Open and
    Save dialog boxes similar to the ones you’ve seen in other graphic user interface
    (GUI) applications with just a few lines of code.

    Figure 1-1 shows an Open dialog box created with just these two lines of code:

    JFileChooser fc = new JFileChooser();
    int result = fc.showOpenDialog(this);

    This code appears in a frame class that extends the JFrame class, so the keyword in the showOpenDialog
    call refers to the parent frame.

    The result returned by the showOpenDialog method indicates whether the user
    chose to open a file or click Cancel, and the JFileChooser class provides a handy
    getSelectedFile method that you can use to get a File object for the file selected
    by the user.

!!! Remember:
    The important thing to know about the JFileChooser class is that it doesn't
    actually open or save the file selected by the user; instead, it returns a File object
    for the file the user selects. Your program has the task of opening or saving
    the file.

    The JFileChooser class has many additional methods that you can use to tailor
    its appearance and behavior in just about any way imaginable. Table 1-2 lists the
    commonly used constructors and methods of this powerful class.
