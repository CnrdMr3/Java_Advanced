/*
    As you’ve just seen, you can create an Open dialog box with just a few lines of code.
    First, you call the JFileChooser constructor to create a JFileChooser instance;
    then you call the showOpenDialog method to display an Open dialog box.
    If you don’t pass a parameter to the constructor, the file chooser starts in the
    user’s default directory, which on most systems is the operating system’s current
    directory. If you want to start in some other directory, you have two options:

    » Create a File object for the directory and then pass the File object to the
      constructor.

    » Pass the pathname for the directory where you want to start to the
      constructor.

    The JFileChooser class also includes methods that let you control the appearance
    of the chooser dialog box. You can use the setDialogTitle method to set the title
    (the default is Open), for example, and you can use the setFileHidingEnabled
    method to control whether hidden files are shown. If you want to allow the user to
    select more than one file, use the setMultiSelectionEnabled method.

    A setFileSelectionMode method lets you specify whether users can select files,
    directories, or both. The options for this method need a little explanation:

    » JFileChooser.FILES_ONLY: With this option (which is the default), the user
      can choose files only with the file-chooser dialog box. The user can navigate
      directories in the file-chooser dialog box but can’t actually select a directory.

    » JFileChooser.DIRECTORIES_ONLY: With this option, the user can select only
      directories, not files. One common use for this option is to let the user choose
      a default location for files used by your application without actually opening a
      file.

    » JFileChooser.FILES_AND_DIRECTORIES: This option lets the user select
      either a file or a directory. For most applications, you want the user to pick
      either a file or a directory, but not both, so you probably won’t use this option
      much.

!!! Tip: In addition to an Open dialog box, you can display a Save dialog box by calling the
         showSaveDialog method. A Save dialog box is similar to an Open dialog box but
         has different default values for the title and the text shown on the Approve button.
         Otherwise, these dialog boxes work pretty much the same way.
