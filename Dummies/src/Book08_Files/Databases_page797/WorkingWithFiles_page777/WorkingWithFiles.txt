/*
    In this chapter, you discover the ins and outs of working with files and directories.
    I don’t show you how to read or write files (for that info, you should flip
    to Book 8, Chapter 2), but you do find out how to find files on the hard drive;
    create, delete, and rename files; and work with directories.

    You find out how to use the Swing file-chooser dialog box that lets you add filing capabilities to Swing
    applications. Finally, you find out how to retrieve parameters from the command
    line — a useful technique, because command-line parameters are often used to
    pass file information to console programs.

    Beginning with Java 1.7, you have two choices for working with files and directories:
    You can use the original File class or you can use the new Path class, which
    is part of a new file-processing package called NIO.2. (NIO.2 stands for New I/O
    version 2.) This chapter covers both of these classes.
