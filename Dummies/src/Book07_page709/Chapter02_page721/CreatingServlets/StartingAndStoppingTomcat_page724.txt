After you install and configure Tomcat, you can start it by opening a command
window, changing to the c:\tomcat\bin directory, and typing startup. A batch file
runs, starting Tomcat. When Tomcat starts, it opens a second command window
that displays various status messages. Figure 2-1 shows the status window in action.

You know that Tomcat has started when you see a line such as the following,
indicating how long the startup took:

> INFO: Server startup in 1186 ms

If the Tomcat window appears for a few seconds, and then an exception message
flies by quickly and the window closes, the most likely problem is that you already
have a web server running on your system, and that server has already laid claim
to the port Tomcat wants to use for HTTP communication. The solution to that
problem is to edit the server.xml file in c:\tomcat\conf and look for this tag:

> <Connector port="8080"... />

Change the port number from 8080 to some other number, such as 18080. Later,
when you display servlets in a browser window, you have to specify this number
as the HTTP port number instead of 8080.

You donâ€™t need to shut down Tomcat after you start it unless you make a change
in one of its configuration files. If you do, you can shut down Tomcat by running
the shutdown batch file from the c:\tomcat\bin directory. Then you can run the
startup batch file to get Tomcat going again.
