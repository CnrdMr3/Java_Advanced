/*
    One of the main jobs of most servlets is writing HTML output that’s sent back
    to the user’s browser. To do that, you first call the getWriter method of the
    HttpServletResponse class, which returns a PrintWriter object that’s connected to the response object.
    Thus, you can use the familiar print and println methods to write HTML text.

    Here’s a doGet method for a simple HelloWorld servlet:

  > Example:

>>> public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
     HttpServletResponse response)
     throws IOException, ServletException
    {
     PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
     out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    Here the PrintWriter object returned by response.getWriter() is used to send a
    simple text string back to the browser. If you run this servlet, the browser displays
    the text Hello, World!
