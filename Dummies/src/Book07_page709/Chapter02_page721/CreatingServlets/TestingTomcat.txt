To find out whether you installed Tomcat correctly, you can try running the test
servlets that are automatically installed when you install Tomcat.
Open a web-browser window, and type this address:

> http://localhost:8080/

(If you changed the port number by editing the server.xml file, as I discuss in the
preceding section, use the port number you specified instead of 8080.)

The page shown in Figure 2-2 appears. If it doesn't, refer to the section “Installing and configuring Tomcat,”
earlier in this chapter, and double-check each step to make sure you did it correctly.
