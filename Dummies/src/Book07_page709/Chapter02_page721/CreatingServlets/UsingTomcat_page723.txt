Unfortunately, you can’t run servlet programs on any old computer. First, you
have to install a special program called a servlet engine to turn your computer
into a server that’s capable of running servlets. The best-known servlet engine is
Apache Tomcat, which is available free from the Apache Software Foundation at
http://tomcat.apache.org. For this chapter, I used Tomcat version 8.

Tomcat can also work as a basic web server. In actual production environments,
Tomcat is usually used in combination with a specialized web server, such as
Apache’s HTTP Server.

-- Installing and configuring Tomcat --

Installing Tomcat isn’t rocket science, but it’s not as easy as making toast, either.
Here are the steps you can follow to set up Tomcat 8:

1.  Download the Tomcat Zip file from the Apache website (http://tomcat.
    apache.org).

        Although Apache also offers an executable setup file for installing Tomcat,
        I suggest that you download the Zip file instead.

2.  Extract the contents of the Zip file by right-clicking the file and choosing
    Extract All; then specify c:\ as the location to extract the files to.

        I know you don’t want to clutter your root directory with a bunch of files, but
        the Tomcat Zip file contains a single folder named apache-tomcat-8_0_0 (the
        version number may vary), so only this one folder is created. After all the files
        are extracted, give this folder a new name that’s a little easier to type. I suggest
        c:\tomcat.

3.  Create an environment variable named JAVA_HOME that points to the
    location of your Java Development Kit (JDK).

        To create an environment variable, open Control Panel, double-click the
        System icon, and then click Advanced System Settings➪ Environment
        Variables➪ New, and create a variable named JAVA_HOME. The value of this
        variable needs to be the complete path to your JDK installation folder, such as
        c:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.

        A common mistake is to set this variable to the bin directory or to the directory
        for the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), not the JDK. If Tomcat doesn’t start up
        later, double-check the JAVA_HOME directory.

4.  Copy the servlet-api.jar file to the jre\lib\ext folder in your JDK root.

        If your JDK is installed in c:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9, copy this file to c:\
        Program Files\Java\jdk-9\jre\lib\ext. You find the servlet-api.jar file
        in c:\tomcat\lib, assuming that you extracted the Tomcat files to c:\tomcat.

        If you skip this step or copy the servlet-api.jar file to the wrong place, you
        can’t compile your servlet programs. If you get compiler messages complaining
        that the javax.servlet package doesn't exist, double-check this step to make
        sure you performed it right.
