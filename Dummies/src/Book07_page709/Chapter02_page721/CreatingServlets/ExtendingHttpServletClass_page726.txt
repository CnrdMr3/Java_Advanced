/*
    To create a servlet, you write a class that extends the HttpServlet class. Table 2-1
    lists six methods you can override in your servlet class.

/*
    Most servlets override at least the doGet method. This method is called by the
    servlet engine when a user requests the servlet by typing its address in the browser’s
    address bar or by clicking a link that leads to the servlet.

    Two parameters are passed to the doGet method:

    » An HttpServletRequest object representing the incoming request from the
      user. You use the request parameter primarily to retrieve data entered by
      the user in form fields. You find out how to do that later in this chapter, in the
      section “Getting Input from the User.”

    » An HttpServletResponse object representing the response that is sent back
    to the user. You use the response parameter to compose the output that is
    sent back to the user. You find out how to do that in the next section.
