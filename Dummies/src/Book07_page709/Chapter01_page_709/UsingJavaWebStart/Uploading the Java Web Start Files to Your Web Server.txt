For this simple Java Web Start application, I’ve created a total of five files:

» ClickMe.java: The source file for the ClickMe application, shown in
Listing 1-1.

» ClickMe.class: The compiled class file for the ClickMe application, created
by the Java compiler.

» ClickMe.jar: The JAR file that contains the ClickMe class. This file will be
uploaded to the web server, and in turn downloaded to the user’s computer
when the user launches the application from the web page.

» ClickMe.jnlp: The JNLP file that references the ClickMe.jar file. This file
will also be uploaded to the web server.

» ClickMe.html: The HTML file that provides a link to the ClickMe.jnlp file. This
file, too, will be uploaded to the web server.

The JAR, JNLP, and HTML files all need to be uploaded to your web server so your
users can access them via a browser. You can use whatever means you prefer to
upload the files. If you prefer FTP, use an FTP client such as FileZilla to upload
the files. If your web host provides an upload tool, you can use it. Or if your web
server is local to your own network (for example, if it is an intranet server), you
can simply use your operating system to copy the files.

Regardless of how you accomplish it, the goal is to get the JAR, JNLP, and HTML
files in a folder on your web server. For the ClickMe application, I uploaded the
files to the ClickMe folder under my web root folder, so the HTML file will be
accessible via the URL http://www.lowewriter.com/ClickMe/ClickMe.html.
