Java Web Start is a way to deploy Java applications via a web page. The web
page can reside on the Internet or on a local company intranet. Either way,
Java Web Start allows a user to run a Java program by browsing to a web page
and clicking a link.

Java Web Start can only be used to deploy programs that have a graphical user
interface (GUI). The best way to develop a GUI program is to use JavaFX, as
described in Book 6. You can also deploy GUI programs developed using Swing, an
older method of creating GUI programs that isnâ€™t covered in this book.

In this chapter, you learn how to deploy a simple JavaFX application via Java Web
Start.
